I’m building a full virtual remote work system where I can:
	•	Appear on Zoom, Teams, and Slack calls as myself (using an -generated deepfake avatar).
	•	Speak in my own voice (using  voice cloning).
	•	Share my “work desktop” (even if using a restricted work laptop) through a masked virtual environment.
	•	Operate through OBS Studio (or better tool) to route all video and audio output seamlessly.

I have multiple remote jobs, and I need this setup so assistants can operate as me, fully automated without suspicion.

Goal:
Make it so my assistants appear exactly like me on video and voice, and share screen safely through a remote setup. No company should notice anything different.

⸻

Scope of Work:

1.  Voice Cloning:
	•	Clone my real voice perfectly.
	•	Allow assistants to input text and output speech in real-time for calls.
	•	Must sound completely human, natural, confident.

2. Deepfake Avatar Video Creation:
	•	Create a professional, realistic video avatar of me.
	•	Must lip-sync perfectly to the voice audio in real-time.
	•	Avatar must be usable inside Zoom, Teams, and Slack.

3. OBS Studio (or similar) Configuration:
	•	Set up a virtual camera and virtual microphone that routes the avatar and cloned voice into conferencing software.
	•	Must be seamless and natural.

4. Remote Desktop Masking / Virtual Workstation Setup:
	•	Set up a virtual desktop environment that assistants can remotely access.
	•	The desktop must allow screen sharing and “look real” like a normal user workstation.
	•	Must bypass the fact that company work laptops are restricted.

5. Integration:
	•	Ensure all systems work together smoothly.
	•	One assistant can log in, operate everything, and companies cannot detect anything odd.

⸻

Timeline:

	•	I need this fully built in 1–2 weeks.
	•	Must be able to move fast and collaborate with others if needed.

⸻

Ideal Freelancers:

	•	 Voice Cloning Specialists
	•	Deepfake/ Video Experts
	•	OBS Virtual Camera Specialists
	•	Remote Desktop Setup Professionals
	•	Security-Aware Developers who understand stealth work environments

What are  agents?

An  agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about  agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop  agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

I’m building a system that automatically generates LinkedIn posts using GPT-4, based on my brand voice and content strategy.

I want it to run on autopilot—generating one post per weekday—without me needing to manually feed it ideas every time. That said, I do want the flexibility to add my own ideas when I choose.

The system should:

Pull ideas from a Notion database (which may include manually entered ideas or content pulled from meetings/notes)

Send them to GPT-4 using a custom LinkedIn prompt I provide

Save the draft in a second Notion database for me to review, edit, and post

I'm looking for someone who can build this using Zapier, Notion, and Open—and deliver a clean, reliable system I can use and later offer to clients.

🛠️ What I Need You to Build:
1. Automation Flow (Zapier)

Scheduled trigger: once per weekday

Pull the next available idea from a Notion Content Seeds database

If nothing is available, system can either pause or use a backup/default theme bank

Send idea + metadata (Post Type, Tone) to Open using a custom LinkedIn prompt I’ll provide (includes voice, structure, CTA logic, etc.)

Output: Create or update a Notion record in the LinkedIn Drafts database

Fields include: Content Idea,  Draft, Tone, Post Type, Status

Mark the seed as “Used” with timestamp

2. Two Notion Databases

Content Seeds

Stores raw snippets, notes, voice memos (manually or automatically sourced)

Fields: Idea Snippet, Post Type Tag, Tone Hint, Source, Status, Date Added

LinkedIn Draft Generator

Receives the -generated drafts

Fields: Content Idea,  Draft, Final Copy, Post Type, Tone, Status, Date Used

3. Integration of My GPT Prompt

I’ll provide a structured prompt that includes:

My LinkedIn content strategy (based on the 4-1-1 rule)

Hook/re-hook formatting

Tone guidance and audience context

You’ll set up the Zap to send dynamic fields into this prompt

🔁 Bonus Features (Ideal but not required):
Option to pull ideas from my meeting notes (Fathom or Google Doc) via Zapier

A fallback system if the Content Seeds database is empty (e.g. random ideas or templates)

✅ Deliverables
Fully functioning Zapier flow (daily post draft automation)

Notion databases set up and connected

Open integration with custom prompt

Simple guide (Notion doc or Loom) to explain how I can edit, review, and reuse the system

🧠 Ideal Background
This project is perfect for someone who has:

The app should assign realistic  voices to characters, integrate background sounds, and provide users with customization options for both voices and sounds.

Key Features:

1. Immersive Script-to-Audio Conversion
Story Magic allows users to upload their screenplay and instantly convert it into a fully produced audio experience. Unlike basic text-to-speech tools, the platform uses intelligent scene parsing to match the emotional tone, pacing, and structure of the script — giving writers and filmmakers the ability to hear their story in a compelling, cinematic format.

2. Smart Voice Assignment with Customization
Story Magic uses -powered script analysis to automatically scan uploaded screenplays and intelligently assign voice profiles to each character. The system reads character cues, scene descriptions, and dialogue patterns to match each role with a realistic  voice that reflects the character’s tone, personality, and emotional weight — ensuring a compelling and authentic listening experience right out of the box.

Users can instantly preview and swap voices for any character or narrator through an intuitive menu, customizing pitch, energy level, and speaking style to better align with their vision. Whether testing different vocal dynamics, simulating alternate casting options, or adjusting for tone, this feature allows for creative flexibility without technical complexity.

It’s like holding a live casting session — only faster, frictionless, and mobile.

3. Realistic  Voice Cloning
The app uses advanced  voice cloning to generate lifelike character performances with natural cadence, tone, and emotional nuance. Voices are customized to match character descriptions, allowing for more authentic scene dynamics. This gives users a strong sense of casting fit and character presence — far beyond robotic or monotone alternatives.

4. Professional Narration Engine
Every script is guided by a high-quality, story-driven narrator who provides continuity, transitions, and exposition where needed. The narration adds clarity to the audio experience, especially in early-stage drafts where scenes may shift rapidly or include visual cues.

5. Dynamic Ambient Soundscapes
Story Magic automatically layers ambient background sound — such as bustling cities, quiet forests, echoing halls, or military tents — based on scene descriptions and context cues in the script. This adds spatial depth and mood, helping users visualize the world of the story through audio.

6. Mobile-First Script Upload and Editing
Optimized for iOS and Android, Story Magic offers seamless script import options from cloud services, email, or integrated writing tools. A clean, intuitive interface allows users to quickly upload, preview, and revise scripts without switching platforms or desktop software.

7. Scene-by-Scene Playback Control
Users can listen to individual scenes, replay specific dialogue, or jump between acts with ease. This segmented playback system helps users focus on pacing, fine-tune edits, or rehearse specific moments in isolation.

8. Shareable Audio Links
Completed audio drafts can be shared via private streaming links with collaborators, agents, producers, or mentors. This feature is especially useful for pitching, note sessions, and early-stage development, making it easier to generate feedback without requiring full table reads or live sessions.

9. SAG-Compliant Voice Licensing System (In Development)
In alignment with the Screen Actors Guild, Story Magic is developing a voice licensing system that allows professional actors to license their voices for use within the platform. This ensures ethical voice usage, generates new revenue for industry professionals, and positions Story Magic as an industry-approved solution in the era of  performance.

10. Revenue Sharing for Film Industry Support
A percentage of Story Magic’s revenue will go toward funding the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, serving as a supplemental safety net for artists and creators facing unemployment or industry disruptions. This built-in support mechanism reinforces the company’s commitment to elevating and protecting the creative workforce.

11. Education-Friendly Access for Film Schools
Story Magic offers tailored access and licensing options for film schools, writing programs, and academic institutions. Students can use the platform to hear their scripts in action, gaining practical insight into performance, tone, and scene structure in a way no textbook or static script can provide.

This survey targets people who work as Securities, Commodities, and Financial Services Sales Agents or had experience in this area before. Please ensure you satisfy this requirement before you participate in this study.

What are  agents?

An  agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about  agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop  agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

Humble. We serve customers with custom software development, and this person must be able to easily communicate with customers without being arrogant about their own amazing skills.

Highly Skilled.  This project is not for your average developer.  This will require senior-level dev skills that have been honed over time with experience.  Thinking out of the box to get things done is important.  A willingness to use tools and not code everything by hand is great, but this is a challenging project.

---

Project Title:
Build a Superintelligent  Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined

Pitch:

Hi,

I’m building a revolutionary  platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life.

This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up.


---

The Vision in a Nutshell

This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide.

It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use  and NLP to:

Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations

Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners

Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities


This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries.


---

What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking):

1. Universal Idea Extractor

Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, -generated archives, etc.)

Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions


2. Niche Idea Research Engine

For every idea, the platform auto-generates:

A full market and audience profile

List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.)

Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers


Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time


3. -Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment

Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions

Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads


4. Automated Branding & Persona Engine

Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure

Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms

Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity


5. Omni-Idea Dashboard

Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches

Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality



---

Why This Matters

I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from  gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating  economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality.

This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum.


---

Who I’m Looking For

A software engineer who:

Can work with /ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines

Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines

Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis

Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas

Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation



---

If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that  can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you.

Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity.

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

This project will be the backbone of a scalable, semi-autonomous outreach machine — powered by n8n, LLMs (GPT-4/Claude), and automated site generation.

Core Workflow Goals:

1. Google Maps Business Discovery:

Pull businesses by zip code + niche (e.g. medspas, dentists, HVAC, legal).

Scrape business name, category, website, phone, reviews.

2. Website & SEO Analysis:

Use PageSpeed API, Lighthouse, or Puppeteer to score:

Mobile-friendliness

SEO tags

Page speed

Visual quality (optional screenshot)

3. LLM-Driven Outreach & Proposal Generation:

Use GPT-4o/o3/Claude to create:

Personalized cold emails

Audit report + marketing suggestions

Branded proposal deck

4. 🔥  Website Preview Builder (Yes, Full Sites):

Auto-generate branded, niche-specific website previews using 

Swap company name, contact info, and services dynamically

Deploy previews on custom URLs (e.g., previewagency.com/demos/xyz-dental)

Optional: integrate Framer, Webflow, or deploy via Vercel/Firebase

5. Outreach & CRM Integration:

Send personalized emails via SMTP, Mailgun, or GoHighLevel

Log contacts and responses in Airtable, Notion, or HubSpot

Deliverables:

Fully built n8n workflow

Working demo of one or more site generation flows

LLM prompts + failover handling (e.g. token limits, retries)

Dashboard for monitoring lead scoring, emails sent, etc. (can be Notion or low-code)

Bonus If You Can:

Use GPT-Vision or Screenshot APIs to assess visual site quality

Auto-classify site issues (e.g., no SSL, missing CTAs, outdated design)

Implement webhook-triggered follow-up logic (e.g., no reply = send case study)

Please Include in Your Proposal:

Experience with n8n,  automation, and web scraping

Specific tools & APIs you'd use (Google Maps, PageSpeed, Webflow, GPT o3, 4o, etc.)

Past examples or similar projects you've built

Timeline and whether you'd build in phases

-Preloaded user profile (""What Atlas Thinks of Me"")
-Basic visual tracker showing strategy stage (Organize → Stabilize, etc.)

Add-ons (Phase 2+)
-SmartScan demo (image upload + scripted categorization logic)
-Additional user flows (e.g., character receives $50K inheritance)
-Tone-aware nudging logic (e.g., “You're 75% through your dining budget”)
-Light animations, UI enhancements, or mobile responsiveness

What I’ll Provide
-Finalized business plan and product spec
-Brand assets and UX flow
-Dialogue scripts and coaching logic
-My involvement. This will be collaborative

I’m open to options between $5K–$15K for Phase 1 MVP depending on depth and scope. Also, open to milestone-based work, part-time engagements, or cash/equity hybrid for the right partner.

A: confirm all ""pip install"" packages needed to run scripts
B: audit and test my script (might have you look over all if your interested)
C: to keep it simple we are buying a new PC to run scripts, so instructions are for a new system setup.

More info:
My kid and I (We have no idea what we are doing) were building a crypto asset price engines, they pulled the data using Binance.us API (has to be USA). They display and logged the prices for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB. We were doing it for fun using Grok  mostly, some Cursor for frontend.

Everything was working great, it was running for weeks and filling our local csv database. (saved as .DB file) then, we were testing other API's and I downloaded some packages like Coinbase API and others, Next thing we noticed the scripts were no later displaying the assets prices when running our crypto engines, just get N/A. Grok  and I realized that binance and Coinbase site packages can create conflicts. We tried everything to figure it out, but no luck. We were ready to call it quits and then I remember this site (Upwork).

NOTE: I used a super lite script to test Binance API and it works and shows the price. So we know it not a API issue. But we we run our scripts we get N/A for prices.. 

To avoid having to figure out what we broke on our own my desktop that we built the engines on, I am buying my kid his own desktop to run the scripts on. So we need you to help us or tell us everything to install (pip install packages) to get our engines running again. 

My kid and I worked 6 weeks on these (something a developer could possibly do in a few hours) but its means a lot to ME, even though I know its nothing fancy.. This is more about something we built together and I want to see it work again (and I know my kid does too). We used 13 FULL, to the limit Grok chat session to build this, so trying to back track and figure out everything we download along the way is a mess. (plus we used Coinbase to start and switched to Binance later)

windows computer
pyhon 3.11.x 

The whole system has 8 crypto engines (rule based) 
3 scripts that work with them engines
They pull from API and fill our DB

Then we have 1 LSTM bot that works with the data
and 3 scripts that work with the LSTM.

Full suit is about 15 scripts. 
Everything was working.

**Objective:**

This part is designed to gather and analyze textual content from various sources, including LinkedIn and Medium, to determine the user’s distinct writing style. This system provides foundational analytics that help in enhancing personal and professional engagement through targeted content recommendations.

**Features:**

1. **Multi-Source Integration:**
    - **Automated and Manual Content Retrieval:** Depending on the platform’s API constraints, the system either automatically retrieves content or guides users to manually upload their posts. For LinkedIn and Medium, where direct access might be limited, the platform will include comprehensive guides on how to export posts. This feature ensures that all relevant content, whether accessible via API or through manual uploads, is captured and analyzed.
2. **Advanced Text Analysis for Writing Style Insights:**
    - **In-depth Content Evaluation:** Utilizing Azure Cognitive Services, this feature performs a thorough analysis of the text to extract sentiment, key phrases, and stylistic elements. By evaluating these elements, the platform can pinpoint characteristic patterns and suggest modifications to enhance readability and engagement. It also assesses the emotional tone and structural aspects of the writing to provide detailed feedback on how these elements influence reader engagement.
3. **User Interaction and Data Handling:**
    - **Interactive User Dashboard:** Built with Power Apps, this dashboard allows users to upload or schedule content to LinkedIn, view detailed analyses, and receive personalized writing advice. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, catering to both tech-savvy users and those with minimal technical background.
    - **Secure Data Management:** Ensures that all user data is handled securely, with robust encryption and compliance measures in place. Azure Blob Storage is used for data storage, providing a secure and scalable solution for managing large volumes of data.
4. **Scalable and Accessible Platform Design:**
    - **Flexible Cloud Architecture:** The platform is built on Azure, providing high scalability to handle varying loads from individual users to large corporations. This scalability ensures that as user demand increases, the system can dynamically adjust resources without compromising performance.
    - **Accessibility and Inclusion:** Special attention is given to making the platform accessible, incorporating features like screen reader support, alternative text, and keyboard navigation options to ensure that all users can efficiently use the application.

### **Part II: Video Processing and Content Generation**

**Objective:**

This section handles video content processing and leverages both textual and visual insights to generate new, engaging content ideas. It integrates with the insights derived from the writing style analysis to offer a comprehensive content strategy tool.

**Features:**

1. **Dropbox Integration for Video Management:**
    - **Efficient File Transfer Protocol:** Monitors locally produced OBS video files and transfers them from Dropbox to Azure Blob Storage based on predefined conditions, such as file age and type, ensuring that the files are completely uploaded and closed before they are processed.
2. **Comprehensive Video Content Analysis:**
    - **Dual-component Processing:** Utilizes Azure Media Services to separate audio and visual components of video files. This separation allows for targeted analysis where audio is transcribed and visual elements are scanned using OCR, enabling a thorough understanding of the content presented in the videos.
3. **Dynamic Content Generation Based on Analyzed Data:**
    - **Intelligent Topic Generation:** The system uses Azure  to analyze combined textual and video content insights to suggest new content topics. This feature aims to innovate content creation by providing users with data-driven topic suggestions that are likely to engage their specific audience.
    - **Automated Content Drafting:** Employs advanced natural language generation techniques to create drafts that align with the user’s preferred style and the newly identified topics, ensuring content is both original and engaging.

### **Enhanced LinkedIn Analytics**

**Features:**

1. **Engagement Analysis Module:**
    - **Learning Algorithm:** Implements machine learning models that analyze past engagement metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and the reach of posts. By correlating these metrics with content features (e.g., post timing, hashtags, content length), the system identifies what factors most significantly impact engagement.
    - **Recommendation Engine:** Based on the analysis, the platform provides specific recommendations for improving post performance. These recommendations might include optimal posting times, suggested hashtags, or changes in content length and style to better resonate with the audience.",AI,C#,,,Proposals:,15 to 20,,,,,,,AI Agent Development,AI App Development,,87.5,"['AI', 'C#']"

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

---

Project Title:
Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined

Pitch:

Hi,

I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life.

This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up.


---

The Vision in a Nutshell

This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide.

It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to:

Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations

Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners

Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities


This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries.


---

What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking):

1. Universal Idea Extractor

Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.)

Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions


2. Niche Idea Research Engine

For every idea, the platform auto-generates:

A full market and audience profile

List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.)

Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers


Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time


3. AI-Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment

Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions

Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads


4. Automated Branding & Persona Engine

Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure

Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms

Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity


5. Omni-Idea Dashboard

Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches

Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality



---

Why This Matters

I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality.

This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum.


---

Who I’m Looking For

A software engineer who:

Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large  pipelines

Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines

Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis

Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas

Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation



---

If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you.

Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity.

In this study, we’re interested in learning how people across different occupations want AI agents to assist in their work. This survey targets people who work as Payroll and Timekeeping Clerks or had experience in this area before. Please ensure you satisfy this requirement before you participate in this study.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

3. Answer brief demographic questions

The survey will take approximately 10–15 minutes.",,,,,Proposals:,Less than 5,,,,,,,,,,,[]

The ideal candidate should have experience in identifying  discrepancies, optimizing event tracking, and ensuring accurate reporting. Your role will involve analyzing current  setups, implementing best practices, and providing recommendations for improvement. A strong understanding of GA4 features and functionalities is essential to enhance our  quality and insights.

Problem: Currently, in GA4, the event “First Visits” and the segment “Users” are likely inaccurate, as they are significantly smaller than what every other analytics platform we use  is telling us they are.

For instance, if we have 100,000 unique visitors a month, it might tell us there were 50,000. We want this fixed.

Solution Request: We’d like you to investigate our GA4, Google Tag Manager, and Cookiescript (our cookie platform) setup to see what the problem might be. We’d like our unique visits to be accurate. Any solution must be GDPR compliant, as many of our visitors are in the UK/EU.

Background: Generally, before April 2024, we didn’t have this issue. However, around the same time Google launched consent mode, we modified several settings in Google Tag Manager and our cookie platform to adhere to this. This completely caused visit tracking to stop working, so we reverted the changes. However, since then, our analytics have been inaccurate.

1. Core Architecture and  Flow
Google Tag Manager (GTM): Centralize all third-party tags and triggers in GTM. This will streamline updates, reduce site code dependencies, and provide a clean interface for managing tags and GDPR compliance.
 Layer Setup: Implement a robust  layer to capture key events (e.g., form submissions, page interactions) with custom  layer events to structure . This ensures  portability and accuracy across tools.
Custom  Layer Events: Capture critical touchpoints, such as Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL), Product Qualified Lead (PQL), and Demo Request for a clear view of conversion points.
GDPR Compliance via CookieScript: Deploy Google Consent Mode via CookieScript to ensure GDPR compliance. Use separate configurations for EMEA and NORAM with conditional firing based on consent status for Adroll, Facebook, Twitter, and Google Ads. This will enable consent-based tracking to enhance privacy compliance.

2. Primary Integrations
Google Analytics 4 (GA4):
One-Way  Flow: GA4 will collect  directly from GTM to capture anonymized, consented events.
Custom Dimensions and Event Parameters: Use these to capture SaaS-specific metrics, such as product usage or feature clicks.
Integration: Connect GA4 with Google Ads for bid optimization and with Google Signals for cross-device reporting. Enable enhanced measurement for broader event tracking.
Salesforce (CRM) and Pardot (Marketing Automation):
Bi-Directional Flow: Sync Pardot and Salesforce with GA4 (via Salesforce to GA4 integration) for end-to-end visibility. This enables tracking the journey from initial traffic source to closed-won stages.
Primary  Pipeline: Ensure closed-won, opportunity stage, and lead score  are sent to GA4 to understand the impact of user journeys on revenue outcomes.
Demandbase, PathFactory, and Qualified (Account-Based Marketing and Content)
One-Way Sync to GA4: Set up direct tracking events through GTM that capture content engagement metrics and account-level interactions.
Account Identification: Integrate Demandbase to GA4 via GTM to track account-level metrics (e.g., firmographic ) and Qualified to personalize content based on visitor .

3. Supplementary Ad and Conversion Tracking Integrations
Google Ads, Bing UET, Facebook, LinkedIn Insights, Twitter, TikTok, Adroll:
One-Way Tracking in GTM: Centralize all paid media tags in GTM. Enable conversion linker for attribution accuracy across sessions.
Use Custom Events: Create custom GTM triggers for high-value events, like Demo Request, Product Signup, and key page views (e.g., Pricing) to ensure conversion accuracy in paid platforms.

4. Conversion Optimization and A/B Testing
Visual Website Optimizer (VWO):
Bi-Directional Sync with GA4: Use VWO’s GA4 integration to report variant performance directly in GA4.
Use GTM: Fire VWO tests through GTM to minimize direct code dependencies. Ensure custom events are created in GA4 for variants to understand test impacts.

5.  Integrity and Accuracy
Regular Audits: Conduct monthly checks to ensure tag consistency,  layer accuracy, and compliance with GDPR/CCPA.
Standardized Event Naming in GTM: Use clear, consistent naming conventions for events (e.g., “lead_form_submit”) across all tools to reduce fragmentation.
 Reconciliation: Cross-reference key metrics between GA4, Salesforce, and Pardot to ensure alignment and accuracy across platforms.

Summary
Goal: A clean, compliant, and unified  flow from first touch to revenue, providing actionable insights into every stage of the customer journey.
Priority Actions:
Establish robust  layer in GTM for tracking.
Implement GDPR consent-based tagging.
Enable custom dimensions in GA4 for lead scoring and journey insights.

Project Overview
We are a debt settlement company seeking an experienced freelancer to build a comprehensive financial tracking and revenue forecasting system from scratch. Our business model involves collecting weekly payments from clients under complex fee arrangements, and we currently rely on manual spreadsheets to track everything. We need a robust solution that can organize our historical , automate our reporting, and provide clear forecasts as we scale from ~70 clients to several hundred.
Background
Our company manages client programs with three different fee structures, which makes revenue tracking challenging. Each client is on one of the following plans:
Plan 1: 15% retainer fee (paid weekly) + 15% success fee upon debt settlement (the success fee is a fixed percentage of the total enrolled debt, paid out in variable installments once settlements are reached).
Plan 2: 30% success fee only (no weekly retainer; the success fee is 30% of the enrolled debt, collected in variable weekly installments as debts are settled).
Plan 3: 15% enrollment fee (paid over the initial weeks) + either a 15% settlement fee or a 10% restructure fee (paid in installments over time as each debt is settled or restructured).
Because of these models, each client’s payment schedule and amounts can vary greatly. We receive weekly ACH payments from clients and need to allocate each payment to the correct fee type (retainer, success, enrollment, settlement, or restructure). In addition, we pay commissions to our marketing partners (10% of the fees from deals they sourced), which we also need to track. Current Process: We export  from two systems — Forth CRM (client and debt information) and Reliant ACH (payment transaction records) — as CSV/Excel reports. Then we manually combine these to figure out how much revenue was collected, what is still owed, and what to expect in the future. This manual process is tedious and error-prone. We want to streamline and automate this reporting. (In the future, these systems may offer API access, so the solution should be designed to easily integrate APIs when available.)
Objectives
The new tracking and forecasting system must enable us to:
Track all incoming payments by client and by fee type (retainer, success, enrollment, settlement, restructure, etc.).
Monitor revenue on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with up-to-date totals.
Calculate total revenue collected vs. outstanding amounts (how much of each fee type has been paid vs. how much is still to be collected for each client and in aggregate).
Forecast future revenue on a weekly and monthly timeline, based on each client’s payment plan and progress (e.g. predict when success fees or settlement fees will likely be received).
Track marketer commissions (10% of relevant fees) to see how much we owe to each marketing partner based on the deals they brought in.
Ultimately, we want a clear picture of our cash flow and revenue projections, which will help in decision-making and identifying any issues early (like clients falling behind on payments).
Scope of Work
We are looking for a freelancer who can take ownership of the entire build. Specifically, you will be responsible for:
Platform Recommendation: Evaluating and recommending the best platform or combination of tools for our needs. This could be Google Sheets with Looker Studio dashboards, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Zoho Analytics, or another suitable platform. The key is that it should be user-friendly, scalable, and easy to maintain for a non-technical team.
 Architecture & Setup: Designing and implementing the  structure to organize all information. This includes:
Creating a centralized payments table that consolidates historical payment  from our CSV reports (and is ready to ingest new  regularly).
Setting up client profile records that include each client’s details, their fee structure (which of the three plans they are on), total enrolled debt, start date, etc.
Encoding the fee schedule logic for each plan so that the system knows, for example, when a success fee should be counted as earned/paid or how an enrollment fee is distributed over time.
Incorporating marketer attribution, linking clients (or deals) to the marketers who referred them, so the 10% commission can be calculated for each marketer.
Dashboard & Report Creation: Building interactive and easy-to-understand visual dashboards and reports that allow us to monitor:
Revenue Collection: Daily/weekly/monthly revenue received, broken down by fee type and in total.
Outstanding Amounts: How much money is still expected from each client and in total, segmented by fee type (e.g., seeing that Client X still owes $Y of success fees).
Forecasted Revenue: Projections of how much revenue we expect in upcoming weeks and months, based on clients’ payment schedules and anticipated settlement dates. This might involve projecting when success fees or settlement fees will come due.
Marketer Commissions: A report or dashboard section showing commissions accrued for each marketer (and total commissions payable), updating as revenue comes in.
Forecasting Logic: Implementing the calculations or models to forecast future revenue. This will likely involve:
Utilizing each client’s current payment status and fee plan to project their future payments. For example, if a client is paying a weekly retainer, the system projects those weekly retainer payments forward. If a client has a success fee due, the system might project when that will be paid based on the client's program timeline or settlement progress.
Allowing for adjustments or assumptions (perhaps a way to input expected settlement dates or completion percentages to improve forecast accuracy).
Summing individual client forecasts into an overall revenue forecast for the company.
Automation & Scalability: Ensuring the solution requires minimal manual effort to update:
Setting up easy import processes (like a defined CSV format we can drop in, or scripts to load the  if using a tool like Power BI).
If using Google Sheets, possibly using Google Apps Script or other means to automate  refreshing.
Designing the system so that adding new clients or changing a fee structure is straightforward.
Building with the future in mind: for instance, placeholder or pipeline for direct API integration once available, so we can eventually automate  retrieval from Forth CRM and Reliant ACH.
Testing and Validation: Thoroughly testing the system with our historical  to ensure accuracy. We should be able to reconcile the numbers from the new system with our existing spreadsheets to verify that all calculations (revenue, outstanding balances, commissions, forecasts) are correct.
Documentation & Training: Providing clear documentation on how the system is built and how to use it. This includes:
A guide on how to import new  (for now, via CSV exports from our CRM and ACH portal).
An explanation of all calculated fields and metrics (so we understand where the numbers come from).
Instructions for maintaining the system or making minor tweaks (for example, if we introduce a new fee structure or want to adjust a report).
If applicable, a brief training session or walkthrough for our team via Zoom or a recorded video (not required but would be appreciated).
Throughout the project, we'll expect regular communication, especially in the initial design phase, to make sure the framework you set up captures all our requirements.
Preferred Platform & Tools
We are currently inclined to use Google Sheets coupled with Google Looker Studio (formerly  Studio) for the dashboards, mainly because of ease of use and our familiarity with these tools. Many of our internal processes are already in Google Workspace, and we appreciate the sharing and collaboration features of Google’s platform. However, we are open to other solutions if they offer significant advantages. For example, Microsoft Power BI or Tableau might handle larger  sets and complex calculations more efficiently, and Zoho Analytics or other BI tools could offer built-in connectors to our systems. Part of your role will be to help us decide on the best tech stack: balancing usability, scalability, cost, and the effort of implementation. If you recommend a platform outside of Google Sheets/Looker Studio, please ensure it still meets our criteria (easy web access for our team, can be updated without specialized software, etc.).
Required Skills & Experience
To be a successful candidate for this project, you should have:
Financial  Expertise: Strong experience in building financial tracking, accounting, or revenue management systems. You should understand concepts like revenue recognition, accounts receivable, and forecasting.
Dashboard &  Visualization Skills: Proven ability to create clear and interactive dashboards using tools such as Google Sheets with Looker Studio, Power BI, Tableau, or similar. Please be prepared to show examples of past dashboards or reports you’ve built.
 Integration & Automation: Experience working with CSV/Excel  imports and ideally setting up automated  pipelines. You should know how to transform and clean  from multiple sources into a unified format. Experience with APIs and  integration is a plus (even if we might not use it immediately).
Analytical & Problem-Solving Skills: The ability to translate complex business rules (like our fee structures and commission rules) into a working  model. An attention to detail is critical because financial calculations must be exact.
Scalability Mindset: Experience designing solutions that can grow. For example, if you’ve built systems that went from handling dozens to thousands of records, mention how you ensured performance and ease of maintenance.
Communication & Documentation: Fluency in English and the ability to communicate clearly. You should be comfortable explaining your approach, asking clarifying questions, and documenting your work for others to understand.
Bonus Skills/Experience: Familiarity with the debt settlement industry or consumer finance would help you ramp up faster. If you’ve worked with CRM  (especially from systems like Forth CRM) or payment processors (ACH systems) before, or if you have insight into typical fee arrangements in debt relief programs, please highlight that experience. While it’s not required, it would definitely be an advantage.
Deliverables
By the end of the project, we expect the following deliverables:
1. Fully Functional Tracking & Forecasting System: A complete system (in the agreed-upon platform) that ingests our  and produces the required outputs. This includes all underlying  tables, calculations, and logic for tracking payments, computing outstanding balances, and generating forecasts. We should be able to use this system immediately with our current .
2. Interactive Dashboards/Reports: A set of user-friendly dashboards accessible online that visualize the key metrics:
Revenue Received: How much we’ve collected, with filters or views by date range, fee type, and client.
Outstanding Revenue: How much is still expected (unpaid) for each fee category, and which clients have outstanding balances.
Future Projections: Graphs or tables showing expected revenue each week/month into the future, based on current client programs.
Marketer Commissions: A report showing total commissions earned by each marketer (and possibly what has been paid out vs. pending, if applicable).
3.  Import Process: A defined process (and any necessary scripts or templates) for updating the system with new . For now, this might be as simple as “paste new CSV  into Google Sheet and refresh the dashboard,” but it should be well-defined. If using a BI tool, it might involve setting up scheduled refreshes or an easy way for us to upload new files.
4. Documentation: Written documentation (and/or brief video walkthroughs) that explains:
How the  is structured (e.g., definitions of each table or sheet, and how they relate).
How calculations are performed (e.g., how the success fee forecast is calculated for a client on Plan 2).
Step-by-step instructions to add new  each week and to maintain the system.
Troubleshooting tips for common issues (e.g., if numbers don’t look right, what to check).
5. Future Integration Plan (Optional): Although not required for the initial build, we’d value a short proposal or recommendations for integrating with Forth CRM and Reliant ACH APIs later. For example, note which parts of the system would benefit most from automation and how you would approach it when the time comes.
We consider the project complete when we can take your delivered system, use it with our latest , and get accurate reports & forecasts without additional development.
Additional Information
Timeline: We would like to get this system up and running as soon as possible, ideally within a few weeks. However, we are willing to discuss the timeline based on your assessment of the work involved. Quality and accuracy are more important than speed.
Communication: We’re available to answer questions quickly throughout the project. We can schedule check-in meetings to review progress and make sure everything is on track.
 Confidentiality: You will be working with sensitive financial  (client payments and debts). We will require standard confidentiality measures (an NDA may be necessary) and expect all  to be handled securely.
How to Apply
If you’re interested in this project, please include the following in your proposal:
Relevant Experience: Briefly describe similar projects you have worked on. Highlight any projects involving financial dashboards, forecasting, or complex  modeling. If you have experience with debt settlement or finance industry , let us know.
Example Work: Provide links or screenshots of dashboards/reports or systems you’ve built in the past that are relevant. Explain what your role was in those projects (did you build the entire system, what tools were used, etc.).
Your Approach: Share a short outline of how you would tackle this project. You don’t need to give a full solution, but we’d like to know what platform or tools you suggest, and any initial thoughts on organizing the  and implementing the forecasts.

Please see below for our project description.

Project Description
We are looking for a detail-oriented researcher or  specialist to help us identify which Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are used by specific U.S. employers. The project involves triangulating  from various sources to determine PBM relationships at the employer level.

You’ll be working with a combination of public  (like Form 5500s), subscription-based tools (e.g., Judy Diamond Associates, MMIT), and other sources (e.g., benefits guides, plan websites, or public filings).

What We’re Trying to Understand
For a given employer (e.g., Walmart, PepsiCo, etc.), which PBM (e.g., CVS Caremark, OptumRx, Express Scripts) manages their pharmacy benefits?

Scope of Work
1. Identify employer health plan details using Form 5500  (e.g., from Judy Diamond or similar tools)
2. Determine the carrier or TPA (e.g., UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, etc.)
3. Infer or confirm PBM used, either:
   - Directly (if named in filings), or
   - Indirectly (by identifying the health plan and matching to a PBM via MMIT or public )
4. Document findings with source links or evidence (e.g., filings, screenshots, public URLs)
5. (Optional/Bonus): Suggest scalable approaches to continue this research across large employer lists

Ideal Candidate Will Have
- Experience with Form 5500 filings or benefits research
- Familiarity with PBM and health plan structures
- Access to or experience with tools like Judy Diamond Associates, MMIT, FreeERISA, or similar
- Strong web research and  organization skills
- Ability to work with minimal supervision and provide actionable, sourced insights

Deliverables
A spreadsheet of employers with the following columns:
- Employer Name
- Health Plan Carrier/TPA
- Plan Type (Self-Funded or Fully Insured)
- Identified or Inferred PBM
- Confidence Level (High/Medium/Low)
- Source(s) or Evidence

Set Up Master Date Slicer Logic

One Date table that controls all pages and visuals.

All fact tables use that Date key (no time‑stamp mismatch).

Must work with Power BI Embedded when we pass date and compare params from the Vue front end.

Validate in Embedded Mode

Show the report in an embed token test page and prove the slicer changes via the SDK drive every visual.

Document Your Work

Short write‑up or Loom video: model layout, key DAX patterns, and how the SDK filters should be called.

Bonus:
If you have design chops, we’ll loop you back in later to polish visuals (themes, layout, etc.). That is not part of this job but good to know.

Must‑Have Skills
Deep Power BI and DAX experience

Solid ‑modeling (star schema, Date tables, relationships)

Power BI Embedded / JS SDK know‑how

Report design and theming

o	Implement automated follow-up sequences based on lead engagement.
o	Accurately determine when a lead meets all qualification criteria.
•	Configure a system for delivering fully qualified leads to the client, which may include: 
o	Real-time notifications (e.g., SMS, email).
o	Direct integration with the client's CRM.
o	Optional integration with a calendar system for automated appointment booking (phone calls, consultations).
•	Utilize a robust automation platform like n8n (highly preferred, as it aligns with the client's understanding of potential solutions) or demonstrate strong proficiency with alternative suitable platforms (e.g., Zapier, Make/Integromat).
•	Provide clear documentation of the developed system for future reference.

Skills and Experience:
•	Proven track record as a freelancer in developing AI-driven automation solutions.
•	Strong understanding of AI/ML principles relevant to lead qualification and natural language processing.

Hello,

I’m a property manager based in Asheville, North Carolina. We currently use Google Forms to send our tenants a pre-qualification form, and I have set up an automation that triggers a ""Pre-Approve"" or ""Disapprove"" email based on certain criteria. With the help of ChatGPT, I had the system fully built and working as intended—until I added a new question about animal breed and deleted a duplicate email column. Since then, the email automation is no longer functioning correctly.

I've tried troubleshooting the issue on my own but have been unable to resolve it. I’m looking for assistance in getting this automation up and running again.

We are seeking an experienced Google Sheets specialist to develop a custom system for efficiently tracking inventory and costs associated with buying and selling sports cards on the WhatNot app. The system will allow the user to input purchase details, manage inventory, and easily calculate cost of goods sold for each livestream show. The goal is to automate and streamline the process of managing inventory, determining costs, and tracking revenue, ensuring an organized and error-free experience.



Project Objective:

The primary objective is to design a Google Sheets-based system that will allow us to:


Track inventory: Log details of each purchase, including the number of items, total cost, and specific details for each item.

Calculate costs for partial inventory sales: Enable automatic calculations of the average cost for groups of cards, especially when only part of a batch is sold.

Display inventory details visually: Allow users to upload pictures and add relevant specifics to each inventory record.

Integrate sales tracking: Track revenue generated from WhatNot sales and compare it with the cost of goods sold for a specific show.

-------
System Requirements:

Inventory Tracking:

Deal Logging: Users can input the details of each purchase, such as:

Seller information

Number of cards purchased

Total cost of the deal

Item descriptions (e.g., card types, series, condition, etc.)

Date of purchase

Quantity and Cost Calculation: Automatically calculate the average cost per card in a batch for cases when multiple cards are purchased together.

Example: A purchase of 57 cards for $350, but only 30 cards are sold in a given show. The system should calculate the average cost of each card and subtract the appropriate cost of goods for the sold inventory.

Sales Tracking:

A section for tracking WhatNot revenue: After each show, enter the revenue generated from that show along with details of the transaction fees and shipping charges.

A formula to calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) based on the number of items sold, including partial inventory batches.

Inventory Visuals:

Allow users to upload images of individual cards or batches, so each item can be visually identified within the system.

Maintain image links to each product record for easy reference.

Show Summary:

A summary page where the total revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and net profit from each livestream show are tracked and automatically updated.

The ability to view past sales performance and easily calculate profit margins per show.

 Integrity & Ease of Use:

The system should be user-friendly, with easy  input and no manual calculations required from the user.

It should be scalable as inventory grows and should handle varying quantities and deal complexities.

Cost & Profit Analysis:

A section for profit/loss analysis that will allow us to see the return on investment for each batch of cards purchased, showing profit margins based on the cost of goods and revenue generated.

-------

Scope of Work:

Initial Consultation and Design

Discuss the specific needs of the user regarding inventory and sales tracking.

Outline preferred layout and flow for the system.

Design an easy-to-use interface that will be intuitive for someone without technical expertise.

Development

Set up and configure the Google Sheets document to track inventory, calculate average costs, and track sales .

Integrate image upload functionality and linking for inventory images.

Build automated formulas for sales tracking, including revenue, transaction fees, and shipping costs.

Testing and Adjustments

Test the system with sample  to ensure proper functioning.

Make necessary adjustments based on feedback or issues identified during testing.

Training and Handover

Provide a tutorial or documentation explaining how to use the system, including how to input  and interpret results.

Offer support for any questions or troubleshooting for the first few weeks after the system is deployed.",Data,Google Sheets,Microsoft Excel,Administrative Support,Proposals:,5 to 10,Python,Accounting Basics,data,data,data,data,Data Entry,,+2,,"['Accounting Basics', 'Python', 'Administrative Support', '+2', 'Microsoft Excel', 'Google Sheets']"

🌟 Project Overview
We run the following 2 research surveys every 6 months—one focused on our users, and one on our target audience and competitive landscape. You may be supporting one or both of the following:
・User Segmentation Survey – helps us understand who our users are, including demographics, characteristics and use cases.
・Brand Survey – looks at how our brand and our competitors are perceived in the market, including awareness, usage, and competitive positioning.

📸 Survey Details
Both surveys were last conducted in Q4 2024. We're looking for your help to replicate them this Spring.
・You’ll be provided with past deliverables as templates.
・Our internal team owns survey methodology and fielding. You’ll receive new raw  collected in April 2025 (exported from SurveyMonkey). You'll be responsible for tabulating and synthesizing results.
・Each survey includes 15–20 questions (mix of single- and multi-select), with one open-ended question.
・No advanced statistical analysis is needed—just clear, accurate tabulation using Google Sheets.

📌 Deliverables
You’ll help us bring the  to life and keep our reporting consistent over time. For each survey, your deliverables will include:
・A Google Sheets tabulation of the raw , following our Q4 2024 format.
・A Google Slides deck (~25–30 slides), structured like our previous report and highlighting key insights and trends in a compelling (and even fun?) way.
・No need to present the deck—our internal team will handle the final readout.

✅ Desired skills and qualifications
・5+ years of experience analyzing survey research using SurveyMonkey and Google Sheets.
・Experience creating polished, visually engaging reports in Google Slides.
・High attention to detail, with a strong focus on  accuracy.
・Ability to work independently and meet deadlines with minimal supervision.

a.  Extraction (ETL Process)
•	OST: Export takeoff  (quantities, types of work) via CSV or API if supported.
•	Quick Bid: Extract labor and cost estimates; exports to Excel/CSV are often supported.
•	Microsoft Project: Use the Microsoft Project  Interchange (MPX/MPP) format or its Project API (CSOM/REST) to read/write task and resource .
You’ll need middleware that:
•	Pulls takeoff and bid  from OST and Quick Bid,
•	Maps that  to tasks, durations, and resource types for Microsoft Project.
Tools to Use:
•	Python or Node.js for building integration services.
•	Pandas, NumPy (Python) for  manipulation.
•	Microsoft Graph API or Project Web API to programmatically modify schedules.
🧮 3. Scheduling Engine
Build or integrate a constraint-based scheduler:

Use a task dependency graph (like in MS Project: Predecessors, Lags, etc.)

Adjust timelines in real-time as manpower changes.

Open-source options:

OptaPlanner (Java)

Google OR-Tools

ProjectLibre (MS Project-like open-source tool with modifiable source)

🖥️ 4. User Interface
Design a dashboard that:

Displays the current project schedule,

Allows slider/inputs to increase or decrease crew per trade,

Shows how that affects the schedule in real-time.

Tech Stack Ideas:
Frontend: React or Vue.js

Backend: FastAPI (Python), Node.js, or Django

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (to store schedule snapshots, user settings, etc.)

🔗 5. Automation & Updates
Set up a daily or real-time sync with OST/Quick Bid changes.

Use webhooks or scheduled tasks to trigger schedule recalculations.

Optionally, send updates back to MS Project using its API or through file export (MPX/MPP format).

🧪 6. Prototype Plan
Phase 1: Manual CSV integration → build scheduling logic

Phase 2: Connect MS Project API → read/write capabilities

Phase 3: Add AI optimization layer for manpower changes

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

We are looking for a part-time (20-30 hours/week)  scientist or  analyst to contract with us on building internal reporting dashboards in Tableau for www.GoodParty.org, where our mission is to make people matter more than money in our democracy.  

This role is primarily focused on dashboard development and minor  transformation, supporting various teams across the organization. You will work with an existing  science contractor and collaborate with team leads as key stakeholders. This is a contract position for 4-6 weeks depending on start date, with the potential to extend.

About GoodParty.org:

GoodParty.org is empowering Independents to run, win, and serve so we can transform civic leadership. In 2024, we helped elect 3,444 Independent candidates into local offices across 48 states. Why?

Americans – especially young people – have been losing faith in democracy. The rigged, two-party system has turned “Independent” into a dirty word. Voters are trapped between choosing the lesser of two evils or sitting out elections altogether.

A majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans nor Democrats represent them. But they keep getting re-elected! Whether you’re concerned about healthcare costs, wars, the environment, our individual freedoms, or inequality, many great solutions are held back by the dark doom loop of dysfunctional partisan politics. 

While mainstream media and the two major parties focus on federal elections (Congress and the President), GoodParty.org is building from the bottom up. With over 500,000 elected offices in the United States—70% of which are uncontested—GoodParty.org is powering the movement to reclaim our communities from career politicians. We’re helping independents in local and state-level campaigns nationwide. Together, we’re building a truly representative democracy where society’s biggest problems are solved.

How?

GoodParty.org empowers independents to run, win, and serve in public office without the influence of partisan or big-money support. Through our free, AI-powered tools, we enable independent candidates to prioritize people over parties and community over corporate funding, transforming real people into civic heroes. We’re a platform, not a political party. 

And, it’s working! Starting with 11 wins in the 2023 election cycle, GoodParty.org set an audacious goal for 1,000 wins in 2024. We beat expectations – 3,444 candidates won this past November and are serving in office across 48 states! 40.3 million voters (26% of all 2024 voters) cast a ballot for our 6,317 candidates. Our general election win rate was 54.5%.

Looking ahead, we’re building on our momentum and expanding our product offerings to help candidates deliver on their promises and serve their constituents effectively. Candidates who partner with us come from across the ideological spectrum and pledge to uphold people-powered principles, anti-corruption practices, and a commitment to civility. Together, we aim to transform civic leadership, bringing real accountability to public service and setting a new standard of leaders who prioritize the people they serve.  GoodParty.org is founded by serial entrepreneur, Farhad Mohit, with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate.

This survey targets people who work as Training and Development Specialist or had experience in this area before. Please ensure you satisfy this requirement before you participate in this study.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

- There's a strategy zone page where users can create 5 different strategies and all the rules that apply to each. They can then name the strategy which links to the monthly sheets drop down lists I described earlier. This sheet also has automatic table  for 3, 6, and 12 month rolling averages  for various metrics per strategy and global per strategy . There is a table that automatically ranks and picks the best strategy based on average R-multiple. There's a few graphs on there also. 

- There's a dashboard sheet with a few charts and various automatic performance  for the global account. 

- there's a journaling sheet for users to write details about each trade and select from a dropdown whether they one or lost the trade then record the mistake that they made. The journal will automatically pull the average most and least common mistake.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

Collect from Ashwaubenon, WI 
This is a smaller area that is part of Green Bay, WI 
Lots of contractors service the area even though they are not near by, also nearby businesses in the greater area will be okay if you run out of emails to pull from Ashwaubenon. 

Find the email for the business, if you can't skip it as this is the most important piece of info. 

Name - Find the first name(s) of the business owner. Include both names of partners - especially husband and wife teams. More than likely the wife is opening the mail! Some places to grab the name are the “About Us” “Our Team” section of the website. Angie’s List is now free and displays the name of the business owner. Of course, manta is a great resource for the owner’s name. The last option is to google, “business name owner.” Some cities have community papers that cover the opening of every new business- owner profile included.
Company - Jot down the name of the business. Leave out the entity info like “Co.” and “LLC” etc. Also drop the extra description the average person would not naturally say in conversation. For example, do not type “Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Drain Service,” write “Roto-Rooter”
Business Type - Notate the company’s main industry or business category.
Description - Write 3-5 words expressing the main qualities of the business's product or services. You don’t have to re-invent the wheel here. A lot of time is spent coming up with a vision for their companies. They know exactly how they want to be perceived by the public. Use their own glowing words from the “About” section of their website or Facebook page. This info will show you know the business and serves as a little under cover sucking up. Pick adjectives that present the business in a positive light. Even if they notice you are parroting their copy, they will also recognize you are familiar with their business and more importantly -their branding. Leave blank if you can't find something to use.
 
Reason - Determine a sensible reason they should participate. Again, check out their website. See what ties they mention having to the neighborhood. Do they mention living or in the area or proudly serving the community for X amount of years? It could be as simple as they have a special offer displayed

Example of how this comes together:

Since you @Reason, we thought @Company might want to feature your @Description to the community.

Since you serve the area, we thought you might want to feature your business to the community

More info:
My kid and I (We have no idea what we are doing) were building a crypto asset price engines, they pulled the  using Binance.us API (has to be USA). They display and logged the prices for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB. We were doing it for fun using Grok AI mostly, some Cursor for frontend.

Everything was working great, it was running for weeks and filling our local csv database. (saved as .DB file) then, we were testing other API's and I downloaded some packages like Coinbase API and others, Next thing we noticed the scripts were no later displaying the assets prices when running our crypto engines, just get N/A. Grok AI and I realized that binance and Coinbase site packages can create conflicts. We tried everything to figure it out, but no luck. We were ready to call it quits and then I remember this site (Upwork).

NOTE: I used a super lite script to test Binance API and it works and shows the price. So we know it not a API issue. But we we run our scripts we get N/A for prices.. 

To avoid having to figure out what we broke on our own my desktop that we built the engines on, I am buying my kid his own desktop to run the scripts on. So we need you to help us or tell us everything to install (pip install packages) to get our engines running again. 

My kid and I worked 6 weeks on these (something a developer could possibly do in a few hours) but its means a lot to ME, even though I know its nothing fancy.. This is more about something we built together and I want to see it work again (and I know my kid does too). We used 13 FULL, to the limit Grok chat session to build this, so trying to back track and figure out everything we download along the way is a mess. (plus we used Coinbase to start and switched to Binance later)

The whole system has 8 crypto engines (rule based) 
3 scripts that work with them engines
They pull from API and fill our DB

Then we have 1 LSTM bot that works with the

This feature ensures that all relevant content, whether accessible via API or through manual uploads, is captured and analyzed.
2. **Advanced Text Analysis for Writing Style Insights:**
    - **In-depth Content Evaluation:** Utilizing Azure Cognitive Services, this feature performs a thorough analysis of the text to extract sentiment, key phrases, and stylistic elements. By evaluating these elements, the platform can pinpoint characteristic patterns and suggest modifications to enhance readability and engagement. It also assesses the emotional tone and structural aspects of the writing to provide detailed feedback on how these elements influence reader engagement.
3. **User Interaction and  Handling:**
    - **Interactive User Dashboard:** Built with Power Apps, this dashboard allows users to upload or schedule content to LinkedIn, view detailed analyses, and receive personalized writing advice. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, catering to both tech-savvy users and those with minimal technical background.
    - **Secure  Management:** Ensures that all user  is handled securely, with robust encryption and compliance measures in place. Azure Blob Storage is used for  storage, providing a secure and scalable solution for managing large volumes of .
4. **Scalable and Accessible Platform Design:**

This scalability ensures that as user demand increases, the system can dynamically adjust resources without compromising performance.
    - **Accessibility and Inclusion:** Special attention is given to making the platform accessible, incorporating features like screen reader support, alternative text, and keyboard navigation options to ensure that all users can efficiently use the application.

### **Part II: Video Processing and Content Generation**

**Objective:**

This section handles video content processing and leverages both textual and visual insights to generate new, engaging content ideas. It integrates with the insights derived from the writing style analysis to offer a comprehensive content strategy tool.

**Features:**

1. **Dropbox Integration for Video Management:**
    - **Efficient File Transfer Protocol:** Monitors locally produced OBS video files and transfers them from Dropbox to Azure Blob Storage based on predefined conditions, such as file age and type, ensuring that the files are completely uploaded and closed before they are processed.
2. **Comprehensive Video Content Analysis:**
    - **Dual-component Processing:** Utilizes Azure Media Services to separate audio and visual components of video files. This separation allows for targeted analysis where audio is transcribed and visual elements are scanned using OCR, enabling a thorough understanding of the content presented in the videos.
3. **Dynamic Content Generation Based on Analyzed :**
    - **Intelligent Topic Generation:** The system uses Azure AI to analyze combined textual and video content insights to suggest new content topics. This feature aims to innovate content creation by providing users with -driven topic suggestions that are likely to engage their specific audience.
    - **Automated Content Drafting:** Employs advanced natural language generation techniques to create drafts that align with the user’s preferred style and the newly identified topics, ensuring content is both original and engaging.

### **Enhanced LinkedIn Analytics**

**Objective:**

To employ advanced analytics to learn from historical engagement  on LinkedIn posts, providing actionable insights that users can leverage to enhance their content strategy.

**Features:**

1. **Engagement Analysis Module:**
    - **Learning Algorithm:** Implements machine learning models that analyze past engagement metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and the reach of posts. By correlating these metrics with content features (e.g., post timing, hashtags, content length), the system identifies what factors most significantly impact engagement.
    - **Recommendation Engine:** Based on the analysis, the platform provides specific recommendations for improving post performance. These recommendations might include optimal posting times, suggested hashtags, or changes in content length and style to better resonate with the audience.",Data,C#,AI Agent Development,AI App Development,Proposals:,15 to 20,,,Data,data,data,data,,,,87.5,"['AI Agent Development', 'AI App Development', 'C#']"

The app should assign realistic AI voices to characters, integrate background sounds, and provide users with customization options for both voices and sounds.

Key Features:

1. Immersive Script-to-Audio Conversion
Story Magic allows users to upload their screenplay and instantly convert it into a fully produced audio experience. Unlike basic text-to-speech tools, the platform uses intelligent scene parsing to match the emotional tone, pacing, and structure of the script — giving writers and filmmakers the ability to hear their story in a compelling, cinematic format.

2. Smart Voice Assignment with Customization
Story Magic uses AI-powered script analysis to automatically scan uploaded screenplays and intelligently assign voice profiles to each character. The system reads character cues, scene descriptions, and dialogue patterns to match each role with a realistic AI voice that reflects the character’s tone, personality, and emotional weight — ensuring a compelling and authentic listening experience right out of the box.

Users can instantly preview and swap voices for any character or narrator through an intuitive menu, customizing pitch, energy level, and speaking style to better align with their vision. Whether testing different vocal dynamics, simulating alternate casting options, or adjusting for tone, this feature allows for creative flexibility without technical complexity.

It’s like holding a live casting session — only faster, frictionless, and mobile.

3. Realistic AI Voice Cloning
The app uses advanced AI voice cloning to generate lifelike character performances with natural cadence, tone, and emotional nuance. Voices are customized to match character descriptions, allowing for more authentic scene dynamics. This gives users a strong sense of casting fit and character presence — far beyond robotic or monotone alternatives.

4. Professional Narration Engine
Every script is guided by a high-quality, story-driven narrator who provides continuity, transitions, and exposition where needed. The narration adds clarity to the audio experience, especially in early-stage drafts where scenes may shift rapidly or include visual cues.

5. Dynamic Ambient Soundscapes
Story Magic automatically layers ambient background sound — such as bustling cities, quiet forests, echoing halls, or military tents — based on scene descriptions and context cues in the script. This adds spatial depth and mood, helping users visualize the world of the story through audio.

6. Mobile-First Script Upload and Editing
Optimized for iOS and Android, Story Magic offers seamless script import options from cloud services, email, or integrated writing tools. A clean, intuitive interface allows users to quickly upload, preview, and revise scripts without switching platforms or desktop software.

7. Scene-by-Scene Playback Control
Users can listen to individual scenes, replay specific dialogue, or jump between acts with ease. This segmented playback system helps users focus on pacing, fine-tune edits, or rehearse specific moments in isolation.

8. Shareable Audio Links
Completed audio drafts can be shared via private streaming links with collaborators, agents, producers, or mentors. This feature is especially useful for pitching, note sessions, and early-stage development, making it easier to generate feedback without requiring full table reads or live sessions.

9. SAG-Compliant Voice Licensing System (In Development)
In alignment with the Screen Actors Guild, Story Magic is developing a voice licensing system that allows professional actors to license their voices for use within the platform. This ensures ethical voice usage, generates new revenue for industry professionals, and positions Story Magic as an industry-approved solution in the era of AI performance.

10. Revenue Sharing for Film Industry Support
A percentage of Story Magic’s revenue will go toward funding the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, serving as a supplemental safety net for artists and creators facing unemployment or industry disruptions. This built-in support mechanism reinforces the company’s commitment to elevating and protecting the creative workforce.

11. Education-Friendly Access for Film Schools
Story Magic offers tailored access and licensing options for film schools, writing programs, and academic institutions. Students can use the platform to hear their scripts in action, gaining practical insight into performance, tone, and scene structure in a way no textbook or static script can provide.

---

Project Title:
Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined

Pitch:

Hi,

I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life.

This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up.


---

The Vision in a Nutshell

This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide.

It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to:

Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations

Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners

Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities


This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries.


---

What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking):

1. Universal Idea Extractor

Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.)

Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions


2. Niche Idea Research Engine

For every idea, the platform auto-generates:

A full market and audience profile

List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.)

Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers


Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time


3. AI-Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment

Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions

Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads


4. Automated Branding & Persona Engine

Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure

Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms

Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity


5. Omni-Idea Dashboard

Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches

Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality



---

Why This Matters

I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality.

This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum.


---

Who I’m Looking For

A software engineer who:

Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines

Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines

Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis

Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas

Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation



---

If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you.

Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

In this study, we’re interested in  how people across different occupations want AI agents to assist in their work. This survey targets people who work as Director/Producer or had experience in this area before. Please ensure you satisfy this requirement before you participate in this study.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

3. Answer brief demographic questions

More info:
My kid and I (We have no idea what we are doing) were building a crypto asset price engines, they pulled the data using Binance.us API (has to be USA). They display and logged the prices for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB. We were doing it for fun using Grok AI mostly, some Cursor for frontend.

Everything was working great, it was running for weeks and filling our local csv database. (saved as .DB file) then, we were testing other API's and I downloaded some packages like Coinbase API and others, Next thing we noticed the scripts were no later displaying the assets prices when running our crypto engines, just get N/A. Grok AI and I realized that binance and Coinbase site packages can create conflicts. We tried everything to figure it out, but no luck. We were ready to call it quits and then I remember this site (Upwork).

NOTE: I used a super lite script to test Binance API and it works and shows the price. So we know it not a API issue. But we we run our scripts we get N/A for prices.. 

To avoid having to figure out what we broke on our own my desktop that we built the engines on, I am buying my kid his own desktop to run the scripts on. So we need you to help us or tell us everything to install (pip install packages) to get our engines running again. 

My kid and I worked 6 weeks on these (something a developer could possibly do in a few hours) but its means a lot to ME, even though I know its nothing fancy.. This is more about something we built together and I want to see it work again (and I know my kid does too). We used 13 FULL, to the limit Grok chat session to build this, so trying to back track and figure out everything we download along the way is a mess. (plus we used Coinbase to start and switched to Binance later)

pyhon 3.11.x 

The whole system has 8 crypto engines (rule based) 
3 scripts that work with them engines
They pull from API and fill our DB

Then we have 1 LSTM bot that works with the data
and 3 scripts that work with the LSTM.

Full suit is about 15 scripts.

We are a SaaS company with a multi-tenant architecture and Kafka-based event pipelines. We are looking for a skilled   to implement an ELT system using:
 - Kafka (event source)
 - Kafka Connect (for streaming  into a central warehouse)
 - PostgreSQL (as the reporting warehouse)
 - dbt (for transformation and normalization)
 - Superset (for reports and non-developer-friendly reporting)

Project Goals:
- Deliver a reliable Kafka → PostgreSQL pipeline using Kafka Connect
- Build clean analytics models using dbt
- Enable our non-technical staff to build reusable, tenant-aware reports in Superset

Current Architecture:
- Each of the 23 microservices (Account, Commerce, etc.) has its own PostgreSQL DB
- Each tenant has its own schema/namespace
- All services emit Kafka events when DB records change
- We are deploying a dedicated PostgreSQL instance as a reporting warehouse

Scope of Work
Phase 0 – Warehouse Schema Design
- Propose and define the initial schema structure for the central reporting PostgreSQL warehouse
- Includes raw Kafka-ingested tables and normalized dbt models
- Should support multi-tenant structure (e.g., tenant_id column, single schema vs schema-per-tenant)
- Design for scalability across services (e.g., account_users, commerce_orders)
- Set up required schemas/namespaces (e.g., raw, staging, analytics)
- Ensure naming conventions and structure are dbt- and Superset-friendly
- Review schema plan with our team before implementation
- Document decisions and structure for handoff

Phase 1 – Initial Backfill (One-Time Load)
- Connect to each service PostgreSQL database (e.g., Account, Commerce)
- Extract historical  from each tenant schema within those databases
- Load the extracted  into the appropriate tables in the reporting PostgreSQL warehouse
- Normalize field types and formats to match Kafka-ingested  for consistency
- Ensure tenant_id and source_service fields are included
- Automate this step as a repeatable script or process in case re-runs are needed
- Document the process clearly

Phase 2 – Kafka Connect to PostgreSQL
- Set up Kafka Connect using open-source connectors
- Configure sinks for multiple topics into the central PostgreSQL warehouse
- Ensure tenant context (tenant_id) is preserved in target tables
- Document topic-to-table mappings

Phase 3 – dbt Modeling
- Create and configure a clean, modular dbt project
- Write initial models to transform raw event  into curated tables (E.g., users, orders, subscriptions)
- Normalize fields across services where applicable
- Add documentation and basic  tests

Phase 4 – Superset Charts/Table Reports
- Connect Superset to the reporting warehouse
- Create example dashboards with filters for:
   - Date ranges
   - Tenant selection
   - Service-specific views
- Recommend best practices for access control (row-level or embedding strategies)

Desired Experience
- Kafka Connect (sink connectors, JDBC, PostgreSQL)
- dbt (including incremental models, Jinja templating, modular structure)
- PostgreSQL (for schema design and indexing in a warehouse context)
- Superset configuration and dashboard setup
- Experience with multi-tenant  structures is highly preferred",data,dbt,PostgreSQL,ETL Pipeline,Proposals:,5 to 10,Apache Kafka,Apache Superset,engineer,data,data,data,,,,,"['ETL Pipeline', 'Apache Kafka', 'Apache Superset', 'PostgreSQL', 'Data', 'dbt']"

-3 large PDFs (~100-300 pages each)
~500,000 text message conversations
-A friendly, supportive, and expert nutrition tone

Scope of Work:

1. Set up Amazon OpenSearch with Vector Search enabled
-Create index, mappings (knn_vector), and configure secure access

2. Set up Amazon Bedrock
-Provision model access (Anthropic Claude, Amazon Titan, or Mistral)

3. Deploy AWS Lambda
-Configure environment variables
-Deploy provided  backend (Lambda function + helper files)

4. Set up Amazon API Gateway
-Create an HTTP API endpoint for the chatbot
-Connect it to Lambda
-Enable CORS

5. Set up IAM Roles and Permissions
-Lambda permissions to Bedrock and OpenSearch

6. Assist with embedding the knowledge base
-(optional) Help run scripts to generate embeddings and upload to OpenSearch

7. Ensure everything is working end-to-end:
-User sends query → system retrieves relevant data → Bedrock generates friendly reply → returns to user

Deliverables:

1. Working RAG chatbot API endpoint on AWS
2. Tested embedding + retrieval pipeline
3. Deployment instructions (short notes)
4. (Optional) Minor updates to the Lambda if needed based on testing

Ideal Candidate:
-Deep experience with AWS OpenSearch, Bedrock, Lambda, API Gateway
-Familiar with vector search, embeddings, LLM orchestration
-Strong  skills (Lambda functions)
-Comfortable setting up secure AWS environments
-Good communicator who can move quickly and independently

Other Details:

-We have a fully organized project folder ready (.zip with backend/scripts/data)
-We anticipate this project can be completed within 10-20 hours
-Future work may be available (adding user accounts, scaling chatbot, building front-end)

We are a small tech company specializing in 3D printing workflows using the Bambu Labs X1C printer. Our current challenge involves networking limitations that prevent consistent file transfer from our proprietary software to the printer—especially in segmented enterprise networks such as those found in universities and hospitals.

The Problem:
Our software stack is built using Electron, Node.js, and . Files are sliced and sent to the printer via MQTT, but the Bambu X1C and the sending laptop must share the same first 3 octets of the IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.x) in order to communicate freely. This becomes an issue on segmented networks where the devices are on different subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.x and 192.168.2.x) despite being able to ping each other and connect via the same router.
This creates a poor user experience, requiring manual IT intervention in otherwise controlled environments.

What We Need:
We’re looking for a network-savvy developer to help us:
•	Diagnose why MQTT communication is blocked across subnets despite general connectivity.
•	Design a workaround or solution to allow our printers and laptops to communicate seamlessly across subnets.
•	Potentially refactor or modify our MQTT communication method to improve reliability in segmented networks.
•	Guide long-term network architecture recommendations for broader device deployments in enterprise environments.
Requirements:
•	Strong experience in enterprise networking (subnetting, VLANs, firewalls, etc.)
•	Experience with MQTT protocol, specifically with cross-subnet communication.
•	Proficiency in Node.js, , and ideally Electron apps.
•	Comfortable working with IoT devices and troubleshooting hardware/software comms.
•	Bonus if familiar with Linux-based slicing servers or 3D printing workflows.

Deliverables:
•	Technical assessment and recommendation document.
•	Working proof-of-concept demonstrating cross-subnet MQTT communication (if feasible).
•	Optional: Code modifications or configuration scripts.

To Apply:
Please share:
•	Relevant experience solving similar network communication problems.
•	Your background in MQTT, Node.js, and network engineering.

Patrons play free on their phone by creating an account at a web site. I plug a Raspberry Pi5 into a TV/monitor in the bar to display questions/leaderboards/digital signage, etc.

Here's how I setup the Pi. I write the image to the SD card then insert the SD card into and start the Pi. It's connected to my Ethernet and it is programmed to load Chrome and immediately load my trivia web site. At this point I type in the bar's login/pass credentials and click a remember me box and the game logs in and starts ""playing at their location"".

I unhook it and either mail or take it to the bar. When I plug it in it can't connect to a network so it shows a QC code that I scan with my phone and the box creates a captive portal that allows you to see available networks and enter the password thereby allowing the box to then run from the client's network.

This all works very well. However, when a HARD restart is experienced by either a power outage, or unplugging power to the PI, the system will load and either not connect to the network AND/OR lose the login credentials/cookies. I have ""solved"" this by giving clients a Pi remote that when the power button is pressed it does a SOFT restart and corrects the issue.

I need to solve this issue as well as find someone who can make sure this box REMAINS connected to WiFi by any means necessary. I understand losing the signal completely is a different story, but it just needs more resiliance.

Our nonprofit produces a large grant reports every month with multiple points of entry. Staff upload evidence files (PDFs, docs) and update a brief narrative directly in Smartsheet. I want a hands‑off solution that:

1. Listens for row edits/attachments via a Smartsheet webhook
2. Pulls the changed rows, fills a multi‑line “Narrative” form field inside a PDF template

4. Drops the final packet into an S3 bucket & re‑attaches it to a “Reports” sheet row
5. Keeps every version in S3 and logs each run (timestamp, row count, file size)

Once built, any staff edit should automatically trigger a brand‑new merged PDF—no manual clicks or Adobe Acrobat needed.

I’m building a system that automatically generates LinkedIn posts using GPT-4, based on my brand voice and content strategy.

I want it to run on autopilot—generating one post per weekday—without me needing to manually feed it ideas every time. That said, I do want the flexibility to add my own ideas when I choose.

The system should:

Pull ideas from a Notion database (which may include manually entered ideas or content pulled from meetings/notes)

Send them to GPT-4 using a custom LinkedIn prompt I provide

Save the draft in a second Notion database for me to review, edit, and post

I'm looking for someone who can build this using Zapier, Notion, and OpenAI—and deliver a clean, reliable system I can use and later offer to clients.

🛠️ What I Need You to Build:
1. Automation Flow (Zapier)

Scheduled trigger: once per weekday

Pull the next available idea from a Notion Content Seeds database

If nothing is available, system can either pause or use a backup/default theme bank

Send idea + metadata (Post Type, Tone) to OpenAI using a custom LinkedIn prompt I’ll provide (includes voice, structure, CTA logic, etc.)

Output: Create or update a Notion record in the LinkedIn Drafts database

Fields include: Content Idea, AI Draft, Tone, Post Type, Status

Mark the seed as “Used” with timestamp

2. Two Notion Databases

Content Seeds

Stores raw snippets, notes, voice memos (manually or automatically sourced)

Fields: Idea Snippet, Post Type Tag, Tone Hint, Source, Status, Date Added

LinkedIn Draft Generator

Receives the AI-generated drafts

Fields: Content Idea, AI Draft, Final Copy, Post Type, Tone, Status, Date Used

3. Integration of My GPT Prompt

I’ll provide a structured prompt that includes:

My LinkedIn content strategy (based on the 4-1-1 rule)

Hook/re-hook formatting

Tone guidance and audience context

You’ll set up the Zap to send dynamic fields into this prompt

🔁 Bonus Features (Ideal but not required):
Option to pull ideas from my meeting notes (Fathom or Google Doc) via Zapier

A fallback system if the Content Seeds database is empty (e.g. random ideas or templates)

✅ Deliverables
Fully functioning Zapier flow (daily post draft automation)

Notion databases set up and connected

OpenAI integration with custom prompt

Simple guide (Notion doc or Loom) to explain how I can edit, review, and reuse the system

🧠 Ideal Background
This project is perfect for someone who has:

Built GPT-powered automation tools before
